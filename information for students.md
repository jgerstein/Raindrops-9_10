Due Dates and Other Information
===============================

**Due Date 1 - 5 points**
* Due by the end of the day Wednesday
* Make sure your GitHub Repository is correctly organized.  Look at mine for details.
* All files should be named correctly, README.txt or README.md should be present and contain a description of what the game will be, and code should be in an appropriate folder.

**Due date 2 - 25 points**
* Due by end of day Tuesday, December 10th for afternoon classes and end of day Wednesday, December 11th for morning class
* Your commit history should demonstrate consistent work on your repository
* Meeting the minimum requirements will NOT be enough for the full 25 points
* For full points, make sure your code is clean and well written and goes beyond the minimum requirements - a class for the timer, a start screen, a game over condition, or visual enhancements might be good ways to go beyond the minimum
* *Requirements for game at this point*
* Raindrops fall individually based on a timer
* Raindrops are removed from screen when caught by catcher
* Score increases when raindrops are caught
* Include comments explaining how your code works

**Due date 3 - 25 points (also see documentation below)**
* Due by 11:59 PM on December 30 for all classes
* Your commit history should demonstrate consistent work on your repository
* Meeting the minimum requirements will NOT be enough for the full 25 points
* For full points, make sure your code is clean and well written, goes beyond the minimum requirements, and builds on the basic concept we worked on as a class
* When you are ready, email me to let me know that your work is ready to be checked
* *Requirements for game at this point*
* Raindrops fall individually based on a timer and are removed from screen when caught
* Score increases when raindrops are caught
* Start and game over screens
* Multiple lives or some other system of determining when the game ends that is more challenging than "as soon as something hits the bottom"
* Visually, the game should be more interesting than the simple circles we started with
* Include comments explaining how your code works

**Documentation - 20 points**
* Create a flowchart documenting how your game runs (15 points) - this flowchart needs to describe the process of the game, not the process by which you write or play the game.  Upload your flowchart as a .PDF file
* Describe your game with any information you think I should have in the README.  This includes any bugs/glitches you find in your program.  It is better to describe them yourself than to leave them for me to find. (5 points)
